# summary method for class `SPQR`

summarizes the output produced by
[`SPQR()`](https://reetamm.github.io/SPQR/reference/SPQR.md) and
structures them in a more organized way to be examined by the user.

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'SPQR'
summary(object, ...)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  An object of class `SPQR`.

- ...:

  Other arguments.

## Value

An object of class `summary.SPQR`. A list containing summary information
of the fitted model.

- method:

  The estimation method

- time:

  The elapsed time

- prior:

  If `method = "MAP"` or `method = "MCMC"`, the hyperprior model for the
  variance hyperparameters

- model:

  If `method = "MLE"` or `method = "MAP"`, the fitted `torch` model. If
  `method = "MCMC"`, the posterior samples of neural network parameters

- loss:

  If `method = "MLE"` or `method = "MAP"`, the train and validation loss

- optim.info:

  If `method = "MLE"` or `method = "MAP"`, configuration information of
  the Adam routine

- elpd:

  If `method = "MCMC"`, the expected log-predictive density

- diagnostics:

  If `method = "MCMC"`, diagnostic information of the MCMC chain

## Examples

``` r
# \donttest{
set.seed(919)
n <- 200
X <- rbinom(n, 1, 0.5)
Y <- rnorm(n, X, 0.8)
control <- list(iter = 200, warmup = 150, thin = 1)
fit <- SPQR(X = X, Y = Y, method = "MCMC", control = control,
            normalize = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
